presentations

overview

verbal lab report
	introduce experiment, little bit of theory, lot about results/conclusions
	keep it to 10 min ~ 10 slides ish
	expect some questions

communication is important
	oral communication
	allows others to hear about experiments they didn't do

ONLY 1 TALK PER YEAR ~ this class

organization/look

basics
	no colors/backgrounds
	no transitions/gratuitous animations
	not too much info
	large enough text to be read from the back of the room

proofread the talk, make sure plts and numbers obey the same rules as in reports

make sure plots are ok in presentation
	not too small
	all features clear
	nothing cut-off/mangled/fuzzy

road map
	intro: tell what you plan to say
	body: say it
	conclusion: say what you said

if long experiment cut it down, focus on important bits

General Tips

make sure emphasis is appropriately placed
	don't spend 9 min on theory
	don't jump straight to plots
	remind what the take-away points are

diagrams/pictures are good
	avoid excessive text/clutter
	it's ok to reuse figures/text esp. if referring back to something later
		viewer will not remember a previous slide - if you refer to something then it needs to be on that slide

Good theory page
	some text, includes pictures
	good diagrams
	shows same idea in multiple ways
	presumably the speaker would clarify some points during the presentation

Good data page
	big clear plot
	labeling, sig figs are correct
	fit function shown, most important fit parameters are highlighted

good procedure page
	one concept on the page
	hand-drawn figure that helped explain the concept is good

bad page
	distracting background
	vague bullet points - want very precise language
	little bit vague is ok/good as long as the speaker elaborates

ok page
	good table, clear with sig figs/units
	there's space left that could have an equation/bullet point/whatever

ok page
	plot is questionable
		fit is good but it's too good based on the size of error bars
		opportunity for follow-up discussion
		fuzzy plots will be questioned - they must be clear
		##see the online presentation##

practice giving the talk
	will get more fluid
	timing is better
	speaking it aloud will help identify the clunky points
	bad sample is on chalk
