# PHYS211

This is my repo for all the University of Chicago PHYS 211 course sequence.  I'll store my code here so that it is accessible and the change history is also available.  This should also allow tracking of the data and keep everything safe and accessible at all times.

Python code is in the relevant folders.  If the time comes to write a specific library and use it often I'll include a python folder.
